# concurrentLargeFileProcessor

Objective:

To develop a Java-based application that processes multiple large files concurrently. This project will help in understanding multithreading, synchronization, file handling, and thread management using Java's concurrency utilities.

Project Overview:

The Concurrent File Processor will:

    Read multiple files concurrently.
    Process the data (such as counting words, filtering specific content).
    Write the processed data to output files.
    Implement features like file locking, progress tracking, and error handling in a multithreaded environment.
